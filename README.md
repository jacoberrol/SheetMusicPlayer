# SheetMusicPlayer
Very basic Python program to teach Oliver how parsers and lexers work.

This program accepts a formatted text file as input (*.sm), which encodes a very simple musical notation, and then plays the encoded song to a MIDI device.

This program demonstrates how to write to a MIDI device using Mido(https://github.com/mido/mido) and it demonstrates how to build a simple parser/lexer using Ply(https://github.com/dabeaz/ply).
